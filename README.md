# 👋 Welcome to My Networking Journey Repository!

## 👤 About Me
Hello! I'm **[Rakibul Islam Nahim]**, a lifelong learner. Recently I am learning deep about Networking, their configuration and how they work in real life senario. 

Every day, I dive deeper into the world of:
- Network fundamentals (OSI Model, TCP/IP)
- Routing and switching (Cisco, Juniper)
- Wireless and WAN technologies
- Network security and firewalls
- Cloud networking (AWS, Azure)

I'm currently sharpening my skills through hands-on practice, lab simulations, certifications, and real-world projects.
