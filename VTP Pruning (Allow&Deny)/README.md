# üë®‚Äçüíº Understanding VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)

## üìÑ What is VTP?
**VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)** is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to manage and synchronize VLAN information across a network of switches. VTP ensures that all switches in a domain have consistent VLAN configuration information.

---

## üí° Why Use VTP?
- üõ†Ô∏è Simplifies VLAN management across multiple switches
- üìà Reduces the possibility of configuration errors
- üß∞ Automates VLAN propagation
- üîÑ Ensures consistent VLAN IDs and names throughout the network

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How VTP Works
VTP uses advertisements to share VLAN information among switches in the same VTP domain. These advertisements are sent over trunk links and contain details about VLANs such as names, IDs, and configurations.

**Basic Flow:**
```
VTP Server Switch ---> VTP Client Switches
```

---

## üî¢ VTP Modes

| Mode | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| Server | Can create, modify, and delete VLANs. Changes are propagated to clients. |
| Client | Cannot create or modify VLANs. Receives updates from server. |
| Transparent | Does not participate in VTP but forwards VTP advertisements. VLANs are managed locally. |

---

## üåê Real-World Example

**Scenario:**
- You configure VLANs on one switch (Server mode).
- Other switches (Client mode) automatically learn and apply these VLANs.

This avoids the need to manually create VLANs on every switch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Explanation: VTP Configuration (Cisco IOS)
**Switch0 Configuration: Server**
```bash
vlan 10
name home
exit
vlan 20
name office
exit
vlan 30
name market
exit
interface fa0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
interface fa1/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20
interface fa2/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 30
interface fa3/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
vtp mode server
vtp domain my.com
vtp password nahim
vtp version 2
```
**Switch3 Configuration: Client**
```bash
interface range fa1/1-fa3/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
vtp mode client
vtp domain my.com
vtp password nahim
```

**Switch1 Configuration: Client**
```bash
interface fa2/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
vtp mode client
vtp domain my.com
vtp password nahim
interface fa0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
interface fa1/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20
exit
interface fa2/1
switchport trunk allowed vlan except 30
```

**Switch2 Configuration: Client**
```bash
interface fa1/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
vtp mode client
vtp domain my.com
vtp password nahim
interface fa0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 30
exit
interface fa1/1
switchport trunk allowed vlan 30
```


## Additonal Note:
- Beware that when you configure switch2 and switch3 you need to be careful, 
- Because Switch2 and Switch3 are both client and connected to end devices. And we need to specify vlan for access port. 
- So must configure vtp client first and then wait for vlan adoption. After the vlan adopt successfully then we try to configure the access port.
- Here a Special case is occur. When you look closely you will find that, Switch2 is only connected to VLAN 30. There is no need to pass VLAN 10,20 data through its trunk. So we will Denay all the traffic except VLAN 30
- Similarly Switch1 holds VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. So there is no need to pass VLAN 30 traffic. So we will configure such that the Trunk will deny VLAN 30 packet.
- This will seems not mendatory at first. But If you are a good Designer and Security Concern then you must need to properly design and configure your network to prevent Cyber threat and Vulnerability

## TroubleShoot:
- Check vtp details ```show vtp status```
- check Vlan details ```show vlan```
- Check Trunk details ```show interface trunk```

## üìà Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| Simplifies VLAN administration | Risk of accidental VLAN overwrites |
| Ensures consistency across switches | Misconfiguration can cause network-wide issues |
| Reduces manual errors | VTP is Cisco proprietary |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices
- Set switches to **transparent mode** if VTP is not needed.
- Use VTP version 3 for improved security and control.
- Always verify domain names and passwords before connecting new switches.
- Backup VLAN configurations regularly.
