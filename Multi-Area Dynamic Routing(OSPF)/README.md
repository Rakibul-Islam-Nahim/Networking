# 🌐 Understanding Dynamic Routing

## 📄 What is Dynamic Routing?

**Dynamic routing** is a network technique where routers automatically exchange routing information to learn about remote networks and dynamically adjust to changes in network topology. Unlike static routing, dynamic routing updates itself without manual intervention.

## 💡 Why Use Dynamic Routing?

- 🔄 Automatically adapts to network changes
- 📊 Scales better for large and complex networks
- 🛡️ Supports redundancy and load balancing
- 🧬 Reduces manual configuration workload

## 🛠️ How Dynamic Routing Works

Routers share routing information with each other using routing protocols. Each router builds its own dynamic routing table based on the exchanged information.

**Key Components:**

- **Routing Protocol:** Language routers use to exchange information (e.g., OSPF, RIP)
- **Metric:** Value to determine the best path (e.g., hop count, bandwidth)
- **Convergence:** Time taken to update the routing table after a change

## 📈 Types of Dynamic Routing Protocols

|                      Protocol                      |      Type       |   Metric Used    |         Best for         |
| :------------------------------------------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :----------------------: |
|         RIP (Routing Information Protocol)         | Distance-Vector |    Hop count     |      Small networks      |
|          OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)           |   Link-State    | Cost (Bandwidth) | Medium to large networks |
| EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) |     Hybrid      | Composite metric |      Cisco networks      |
|           BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)            |   Path-Vector   | Path attributes  | Internet (ISP networks)  |

## 👥 Advantages and Disadvantages

|               Advantages               |              Disadvantages               |
| :------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|   Self-adjusting to network changes    | Higher CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage  |
|      Scalable to large topologies      |        More complex configuration        |
| Supports multiple paths and redundancy | Risk of routing loops without safeguards |

## 🔍 Project Explanation: Multi-Area OSPF

**Router0 Configuration: (Area Zero)**

```bash
interface fa0/0
ip address 172.17.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
interface se2/0
ip address 172.17.12.1 255.255.255.0
clock rate 64000
no shutdown
exit
router ospf 1
network 172.17.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 172.17.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
```

**Router1 Configuration: (Area Zero)**

```bash
interface fa0/0
ip address 172.17.11.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
interface se2/0
ip address 172.17.12.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
interface se3/0
ip address 172.17.13.1 255.255.255.0
clock rate 64000
no shutdown
exit
router ospf 1
network 172.17.11.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 172.17.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 172.17.13.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
```

**Router2 Configuration: (bridge router)**

```bash
interface se3/0
ip address 172.17.13.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
interface se2/0
ip address 172.17.14.1 255.255.255.0
clock rate 64000
no shutdown
exit
router ospf 1
network 172.17.13.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 172.17.14.0 0.0.0.255 area 1
```

**Router3 Configuration: (Area One)**

```bash
interface fa0/0
ip address 172.17.15.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
interface se2/0
ip address 172.17.14.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
router ospf 1
network 172.17.14.0 0.0.0.255 area 1
network 172.17.15.0 0.0.0.255 area 1
```

This allows routers to dynamically share routes inside Area 0.

## 🌐 Multi-Area OSPF

**Multi-area OSPF** is an advanced implementation of OSPF that divides a large OSPF domain into smaller, more manageable areas. This reduces routing overhead, shortens convergence time, and enhances network performance.

### 🌪️ Why Use Multi-Area OSPF?

- 📊 Optimizes performance in large networks
- 🚀 Reduces CPU and memory usage on routers
- 🛡️ Provides better route summarization and scalability

### 🔄 Area Types

- **Backbone Area (Area 0):** Core of the OSPF network; all other areas must connect to it.
- **Regular Areas:** Standard OSPF areas.
- **Stub Areas:** Do not receive external routes.
- **Totally Stubby Areas:** Further restricts external and inter-area routes.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Dynamic Routing

- Use `show ip route` to view the routing table.
- Use `show ip protocols` to check running routing protocols.
- Use `debug ip routing` carefully to watch routing changes.
- For OSPF: `show ip ospf neighbor`, `show ip ospf database`, `show ip ospf interface`.
